# Event Framework

The purpose of the Event Framework is to provide a standard unified architecture to capture all Mojaloop events.

_Disclaimer: This is experimental and is being implemented as a PoC. As such the design may change based on the evolution of the PoC's implementation, and any lessons learned._


## 1. Requirements

- Events will be produced by utilising a standard common library that will publish events to a sidecar component utilising a light-weight highly performant protocol (e.g. gRPC).
- Sidecar module will publish events to a singular Kafka topic that will allow for multiple handlers to consume and process the events as required.
- Kafka partitions will be determined by the event-type (e.g. log, audit, trace, errors etc).
- Each Mojaloop component will have its own tightly coupled Sidecar.
- Event messages will be produced to Kafka using the Trace-Id as the message key. This will ensure that all the messages part of the same trace (transaction) are stored in the same partition in order.

## 4. Tracing Design

### 4.1 HTTP Transports

Below find the current proposed standard HTTP Transport headers for tracing. 

Mojaloop has yet to standardise on either standard, or if it will possible support both.

#### 4.1.1 WC3 Http Headers

Refer to the following publication for more information: https://w3c.github.io/trace-context/ 

| Header | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| traceparent | Dash delimited string of tracing information: \<version\>-\<trace-id\>-\<parent\/span-id\>-\<trace-flags\> | 00-4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736-00f067aa0ba902b7-00 |
| tracestate | Comma delimited vendor specific format captured as follows: \<vendor\>=\<base64-encoded-state\>| congo=t61rcWkgMzE,rojo=00f067aa0ba902b7 |

Note: Before this specification was written, some tracers propagated X-B3-Sampled as true or false as opposed to 1 or 0. While you shouldn't encode X-B3-Sampled as true or false, a lenient implementation may accept them.

#### 4.1.2 B3 HTTP Headers

Refer to the following publication for more information: https://github.com/apache/incubator-zipkin-b3-propagation

| Header | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| X-B3-TraceId | Encoded as 32 or 16 lower-hex characters. | a 128-bit TraceId header might look like: X-B3-TraceId: 463ac35c9f6413ad48485a3953bb6124. Unless propagating only the Sampling State, the X-B3-TraceId header is required. |
| X-B3-SpanId | Encoded as 16 lower-hex characters. | a SpanId header might look like: X-B3-SpanId: a2fb4a1d1a96d312. Unless propagating only the Sampling State, the X-B3-SpanId header is required. |
| X-B3-ParentSpanId | header may be present on a child span and must be absent on the root span. It is encoded as 16 lower-hex characters. | A ParentSpanId header might look like: X-B3-ParentSpanId: 0020000000000001 |
| X-B3-Sampled | An accept sampling decision is encoded as `1` and a deny as `0`. Absent means defer the decision to the receiver of this header. | A Sampled header might look like: X-B3-Sampled: 1. |
| X-B3-Flags | Debug is encoded as `1`. Debug implies an accept decision, so don't also send the X-B3-Sampled header. | |

### 4.2 Kafka Transports

Refer to `Event Envelope Model` section. This defines the message that will be sent through the Kafka transport.

Alternatively the tracing context could be stored in Kafka headers which are only supports v0.11 or later. Note that this would break support for older versions of Kafka.

### 4.3 Known limitations

- Transfer tracing would be limited to each of the transfer legs (i.e. Prepare and Fulfil) as a result of the Mojaloop API specification not catering for tracing information. The trace information will be send as part of the callbacks by the Switch, but the FSPs will not be required to respond appropriately with a reciprocal trace headers.
